TriGame
=======
TriGame is a 2D Java game. You play as blue triangle and fight off the evil red triangles. Your only goal is to keep you and your HQ alive. Guns and towers, defensive and offensive, are at your disposal. The battle may never end but how long can you survive?

It is highly recommended that you set one of these to true when you startup the game: -Dsun.java2d.d3d=true or -Dsun.java2d.opengl=true.
